About Dataset
Introduction
This is a collection of 1 minute candlesticks of the top 1000 cryptocurrency pairs on Binance.com. In total there are 1971, but Kaggle limits file count to 1000. Both retrieval and uploading the data is fully automated‚Äîsee this GitHub repo.

Content
For every trading pair, the following fields from Binance's official API endpoint for historical candlestick data are saved into a Parquet file:

 #   Column                        Dtype         
---  ------                        -----         
 0   open_time                     datetime64[ns]
 1   open                          float32       
 2   high                          float32       
 3   low                           float32       
 4   close                         float32       
 5   volume                        float32       
 6   quote_asset_volume            float32       
 7   number_of_trades              uint16        
 8   taker_buy_base_asset_volume   float32       
 9   taker_buy_quote_asset_volume  float32       
dtypes: datetime64[ns](1), float32(8), uint16(1)
The dataframe is indexed by open_time and sorted from oldest to newest. The first row starts at the first timestamp available on the exchange, which is July 2017 for the longest running pairs.

Here are two simple plots based on a single file; one of the opening price with an added indicator (MA50) and one of the volume and number of trades:


Inspiration
One obvious use-case for this data could be technical analysis by adding indicators such as moving averages, MACD, RSI, etc. Other approaches could include backtesting trading algorithms or computing arbitrage potential with other exchanges.
